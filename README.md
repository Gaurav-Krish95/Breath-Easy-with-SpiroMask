# Spiromask Project: A Sonic Journey into Lung Function
## Introduction
Welcome, fellow explorers of the human body! I, Gaurav, invite you on a unique expedition ‚Äì a deep dive into the captivating world of lung function using an innovative tool known as the Spiromask.
Our mission? To unveil the secrets of breathing, the very essence of life. Buckle up as we venture into the intricate details of differentiating breathing rate from sampling rate ‚Äì a crucial aspect in understanding lung health.
## Tools of the trade

## 1. Audacity
Are trustworthy companion on this journey is audacity,a powerful audio recording software. With its help we will capture the symphony of breaths inhalation, and exhalations.

## 2. The Launchpad
My trusty laptop serves as our launchpad. Its keys hum with anticipation, ready to record every nuance of our sonic exploration.

## 3. My Voice
As your guide, my voice will lead us through this auditory adventure. Listen closely ‚Äì each breath holds a story waiting to be told.

# The Goal
As you relax and listen, remember that our purpose transcends mere entertainment. We seek valuable insights into lung function. Let the symphony guide you deeper, beyond the surface ‚Äì where science and creativity harmonize.
## 1. Breathing frequency range:

## 2. Plotting spectogram

## 3. applying high pass filter

## 4. Loading udio data

## Setup of settings in audacity
#### First after recording in audacity, we have to filter higher frequencies from high pass filter for that apply 20Hz for precision and then we have to plot spectogram to observe frequency range[ y-axis is frequency and x-axis is representing time ]

#### Humans have breath per min is from range of 12 to 24 breath per min (0.2 to 0.4 Hz) so we will zoom out to vertical axis because it represents freuency in hz

#### we can't measure accurately from spectogram so we have to zoom out to observe strips with constant contrast is breathing frequency
